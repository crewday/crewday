# Claude Code configuration for crew.day

This directory holds agent-development configuration for anyone operating on
the crew.day codebase with an AI coding tool (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor,
OpenClaw, etc.).

> Authoritative rules live in the top-level [`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md).
> The files in this directory are the *how* — standards, playbooks, and
> specialised agent roles — that support those rules.

## Status

crew.day is **pre-implementation**. The repo currently contains specs only
(see [`docs/specs/`](../docs/specs/)). The agents and skills here are sized
for that reality: the most useful ones right now are `audit-spec`,
`selfreview`, `director`, `gap-finder`, and `security-check` — all of which
operate primarily on specifications. More will land as code does.

## Skills vs. agents

- **Skills** describe *how* to do something — a playbook loaded for a
  particular kind of task.
- **Agents** describe *who* does something — a role with its own constraints
  and output format, usually invoked by the Director.

Most day-to-day work goes through skills. Agents are used when a task is
large enough that it helps to separate implementation from review, or when a
decision is hard enough to warrant a dedicated research role.

## Typical workflow

```
DIRECTOR (plan) → CODER (implement) → REVIEWER (verify)
                                           │
                    (CHANGES_REQUIRED) ←───┘
                                           │
                                  (APPROVED) ↓
                                    DOCUMENTER (specs + READMEs)
                                           │
                                           ▼
                                    COMMITER (commit + push)
```

For hard problems, any agent may invoke **ORACLE** for deep research.
